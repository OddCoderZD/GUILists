# GUILists
A GUI for Stack, Array, and Queue. You can also write your own custom at the bottom of the code. Currently, the example code is a Favorite's List.

Purpose: This is my honors assignment for my Data Structures Class at SFA. This is to help Dr. Becnel explain the process of how lists work, custom or not. If any one else wishes to use this code, please feel free
especially with the CUSTOM section of the lists, to form your own.
Also fair warning that this code takes a VERY long time to load, and you will see it all as errors for a few minutes, i'd heavily reccomend re-opening the code to prevent that. Thank you :D
